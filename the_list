I found writing Sequtus that there were a lot of things that I took for
granted in RTS and the project started to seem like it would never get
anywhere. I thus made this list of all the things you might want to include
in an RTS, you can pick from here what you want in your game and get a much
more accurate idea of how far through it you are. If you have anything to
add to the list then please do let me know.
